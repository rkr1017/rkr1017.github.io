</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Both experiment and
control groups visit the page initially, so “Number of cookies”
is invariant and both groups see two buttons initially, so “Number
of clicks” should not be different (is invariant).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Gross conversion”
represents those who made a decision to enroll after passing
commitment time test, which should be different in an experimental
group compared to control. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Retention”
means user moved further down the road and made a payment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Net conversion”
tracks users clicked <span style="background: #ffffff">&quot;Start

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Gross conversion”
tracks users who started trial, stayed on course and enrolled. That
metric is evaluating the first part of the hypothesis “<font color="#58646d"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="background: #ffffff">…this
might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing
the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because
they didn't have enough time”</span></font></font>. Would those who
started be less likely to leave before enrolling? It is expected to
have a higher value in an experiment group. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Net conversion”
tracks a group of users, those who stayed for at least 14 days after
starting a trial. It is evaluating the second part of the initial
hypothesis: “<font color="#58646d"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="background: #ffffff">without
significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the
free trial and eventually complete the course“. Would those who
started trial stay for the most part? It is expected to be not much
different between control and experiment.</span></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Retention”
tracks a group of users, those who stayed for at least 14 days after
enrolling. <font color="#58646d"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="background: #ffffff">Would
those who enrolled stay for the most part? This is a somewhat
redundant metric designed to evaluate a second part of the
hypothesis. </span></font></font>“Net conversion” seems to track
the second part better because it covers a wider range of events.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Metrics not
chosen as either invariant of evaluation:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Number of
user-ids: </b>This metric cannot be used as<b> </b>an invariant
because it tracks activity that would be different between experiment
and control groups. In the experiment group enrollment happens after
the answer on a time commitment question. For the usage as an
evaluation metric it is less informative than chosen evaluation
metrics because it missing the connection to a user who started free
trial. We are aiming at figuring out if a user who started free trial
continued with the course and enrolled which is much better
represented by “Gross conversion”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Click-through-probability:
</b>This metric cannot be an evaluation metric because it tracks
activity before there is a difference between experiment and control.
At the same time it does not provide any information in addition to a
“Number of cookies” metric and adds complexity in calculations,
so it does not make sense to use it as an invariant metric.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No Bonferroni
correction. Number of pageviews: 4741212. Sample size calculated
using on-line calculator for Retention (53%, biggest probability).
After that samplesize was multiplied by 2 for control and experiment
and scaled by enrollement/(unique cookies to view page).</p>

<h3 class="western"><a name="h.uy2xamy5nbp"></a>Duration vs. Exposure</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I decided to divert
all traffic to this experiment (fraction = 1). It would take 119 days
to complete experiment if all three evaluation metrics are used,
which is too long. To reduce the duration the “Retention” metric
was dropped as the one taking longest time. Now only two metrics are
left: Gross conversion and Net conversion. Net conversion requires
largest sample size of the two: 27413 and the number of pageviews is
685325. It would take 18 days to run the experiment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It does not seem to
be risky to divert that much traffic. Participants will not be hurt
because their choices will not be limited in any way in the
experiment group. They will still be presented with the same choices
in their course participation, but in slightly different arrangement
that may actually benefit them in reducing time wasted and
frustration. The sensitivity of the data is not increased in an
experiment group; no additional sensitive data is collected.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I did not use
Bonferroni correction. We would use Bonferroni if any one metric in a
series being statistically significant would warrant launching. In
this case we would want to avoid Type I error. In our case we use two
metrics which account for two different parts of our hypothesis. We
want both of them to be statistically significant in order to
recommend launch.

<h2 class="western"><a name="h.2iroxj5zbf41"></a>Recommendation</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I would not
recommend launching this experiment. I believe the stated goal
“<span style="background: #ffffff">reducing the number of
frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have
enough time” is achieved due to a statistical and practical
significance of the gross conversion metric. </span>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><a name="_GoBack"></a>
Net conversion metric is not significantly different between
experiment and control. It is probably lower than in the original
site design due to the zero locating closer to the right side of the
confidence interval and probability of success in sign test 0.4348,
less than 0.5. If to take in account the minimal difference
established for this metric from the business prospective
(d<sub>min</sub>=0.0075), then the confidence interval includes the
negative value of the practical boundary (-0.0075). It may mean that
the metric decreased in value enough to not recommend a launch
because it does not support the second part of the hypothesis
“…<span style="background: #ffffff">without significantly
reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and
eventually complete the course”.</span></p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="h.oz1x1oon17xf"></a>Follow-Up Experiment</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Give a high-level
description of the follow up experiment you would run, what your
hypothesis would be, what metrics you would want to measure, what
your unit of diversion would be, and your reasoning for these
choices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">If
to reduce the number of frustrated students who cancel early in the
course, I would follow-up with increasing cutoff time spent each week
on the project. Five hours a week may not be a realistic time for an
average person to complete the whole course in a reasonable amount of
time, say few months. It is not just an amount of time per week, but
also an overall rate of the progress is important for the retention.
5 hours would probably mean rather slow progression for the majority
of people taking the course. I believe a cutoff time of at least 10
hours should be tested. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><span style="background: #ffffff">The
metrics and the unit of diversion should remain the same as before.</span></p>
